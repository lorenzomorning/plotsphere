# :globe_with_meridians: Plotsphere

This package is developed for plotting spatial feature geometries on a interactive 3D sphere. As the package sf switchted to default spatial operations on a sphere for ellipsoidal and geographical coordinates (such as in WGS 84), this package enables the use to also plot this data on a sphere. However, as attributes of the simple features are neglected, the main purpose of the spherical plotting is comparing between spherical geometries and how projected geospatial data would look like on a sphere. And honestly, a sphere approaches the complex shaped Earht better than a flat 2D space as it is used in most GISystems.

:earth_africa: Have fun with exploring your spatial geometries! :earth_asia:
